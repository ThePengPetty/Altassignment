        <h2>Why I Joined AltSchool</h2>
        <p>Firstly it was for the buzz "dollars in tech" but I wanted something
            easy because I'm a proper english babe, maybe a non Technical skill
            but my mom said "why are you going easy, Challenge yourself" <br/>Then I went
            for Frontend because I wanted to know how creating a web worked, and because
            I knew deepdown that I can do anything</p>
